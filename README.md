create-react-app:

When you run create-react-app , environment will have everything we need to build a modern single-page React app:

⦁	Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.

⦁	Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need -webkit- or other prefixes.

⦁	A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.

⦁	A live development server that warns about common mistakes.

⦁	Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.
